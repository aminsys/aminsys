# Hello there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StanGirard/StanGirard/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Amin and I'm a Software developer.

## &#x270d; About me
I am passionate about programming as it has unlimited potential to solving real-world problems as well as producing new services that were never thought of.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about API design and development. I am also exploring the use of Docker, MongoDB, Golang, as well as how to get them to work together.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m willing to collaborate on any project to gain more experience and insights into existing and new technologies.
